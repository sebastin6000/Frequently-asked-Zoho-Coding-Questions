# DSA with Java for Zoho Interviews 🖥️💡

This repository is dedicated to solving **most frequently asked Zoho coding questions**. It aims to help you prepare for Zoho interviews by providing Java-based solutions. We are actively creating and regularly updating a **problem-solving template** that will guide you step-by-step in efficiently solving coding problems in a structured manner.

## Zoho CheatSheet:
[Zoho CheatSheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C9AmL3lmO_B-Ufhh_rDN_X9NKFIJrF6Ru3dS2FdoJrk/edit?usp=sharing)<br/> 

## Key Features: 🌟
- Solutions to popular **Zoho coding questions**. 📑
- Java-based implementations for each problem. 💻
- A **regularly updated problem-solving template**. 📝
- Detailed explanations of the approach and solution. 🔍
- Focus on writing clean, efficient, and optimized code. 🚀

## Problem-Solving Template 🧩

Our approach to solving coding problems follows a structured template:

1. **Information Extracting from the Problem Statement**:  
   - Read the problem statement carefully and extract all relevant details, including inputs, outputs, and constraints.

2. **Thinking in a Conversational Manner**:  
   - Conceptualize the problem in simple terms and think about how you would solve it in a real-life scenario.

3. **Converting the Conversational Solution into Subtasks**:  
   - Break down the solution into smaller, manageable tasks that can be solved step-by-step.

4. **Converting the Subtasks into Code**:  
   - Implement the solution by converting each subtask into code in a structured and logical manner.

### Future Updates:
- **Optimization**: We will continuously work on improving the efficiency of the solutions. ⏳
- **Testing**: Additional test cases and testing strategies will be added in future updates. 🧪

This repository is continuously growing, and we encourage contributions from anyone to improve the templates and solutions!

Happy coding, and good luck with your Zoho interview preparation! 🎯
