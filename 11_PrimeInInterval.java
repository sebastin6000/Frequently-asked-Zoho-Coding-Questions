Question Section:
Given two numbers `a` and `b` as the interval range, the task is to find the prime numbers in between this interval.

Examples: 

Input: a = 1, b = 10
Output: 2, 3, 5, 7

Input: a = 10, b = 20
Output: 11, 13, 17, 19
*/

/* 
Understanding the Problem Statement:
- We are given two integers `a` and `b` which define an interval [a, b].
- The task is to find all the prime numbers between `a` and `b` (inclusive).
- A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
- The output should list all the prime numbers in the interval in ascending order.

What is being asked?
- The goal is to identify and print the prime numbers in the given range [a, b].

Expected Output:
   - A list of prime numbers in the range [a, b].

*/

 /* 
Extracting Information from the Problem Statement:
1. Input data type:
   - Two integers `a` and `b` representing the interval.

2. Output return type:
   - A list of integers representing the prime numbers within the given range.
3. Explanation of Time complexity expectations:
   - The primality check for a single number takes O(sqrt(N)) time.
   - We will need to check all numbers from `a` to `b`, so the overall time complexity will be O((b - a) * sqrt(b)).
4. Explanation of given Constraints:
   - There are no explicit constraints, but based on typical prime number problems, 
     we assume that the range `a` to `b` is reasonably sized (not exceeding 10^6 or so).
*/

 /* 
Thinking Solution for the Problem Statement:
1. Identification:
   - This is a problem of finding all prime numbers in a given interval.
   - We need to apply a primality test for every number in the range [a, b].

2. Destructuring:
   - Step 1: Iterate through all numbers in the range [a, b].
   - Step 2: For each number, check if it is prime.
   - Step 3: If a number is prime, add it to the result list.
   - Step 4: Finally, print the list of prime numbers.

3. Conversional solution into smaller subtask:
   - Subtask 1: Create a function to check if a number is prime.
   - Subtask 2: Iterate through the range [a, b], check each number for primality, and store the primes.
   - Subtask 3: Output the list of prime numbers.

*/

 /* 
Conversional Solution into Subtasks:
1. Prime checking function: 
   - Implement a function to check if a number is prime using a trial division method up to sqrt(num).
2. Loop over the range [a, b] and check if each number is prime.
3. Print the primes found in the interval.

*/

 /* 
Subtasks of Conversional Solution into Code:
1. Implement a `isPrime(int num)` function to check for prime numbers.
2. Implement a main function that iterates through the interval [a, b], checks primality for each number, and collects prime numbers.
3. Output the prime numbers found within the given range.

    Time and Space Complexity Explanation:
    Time Complexity:
    - The `isPrime()` function runs in O(sqrt(N)) time for a given number N, as it checks divisibility from 2 to âˆšN.
    - We will call the `isPrime()` function for each number in the range [a, b], so the total time complexity is O((b - a) * sqrt(b)).
    - For large ranges, this is efficient enough to handle typical inputs within the problem's constraints.

    Space Complexity:
    - The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space (for loop variables and a small number of temporary variables).

    /* 
    Code Walkthrough:
    Let's walk through the example with `a = 1` and `b = 10`:

    1. Call `printPrimesInRange(1, 10)`:

        - Check if 2 is prime (it is, so print 2).
        - Check if 3 is prime (it is, so print 3).
        - Check if 4 is prime (it's not).

        - Check if 6 is prime (it's not).
        - Check if 7 is prime (it is, so print 7).
        - Check if 8 is prime (it's not).
        - Check if 9 is prime (it's not).
        - Check if 10 is prime (it's not).

/*
### Explanation:

1. **`isPrime(int num)`**: 
This function checks whether a given number `num` is prime. It returns `true` if the number is prime, 
and `false` otherwise. The function efficiently checks divisibility up to `sqrt(num)`.

2. **`printPrimesInRange(int a, int b)`**: 
This function iterates through all numbers from `a` to `b` and checks whether each number is prime using the `isPrime` function. 
If a number is prime, it is printed.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of checking whether a number is prime is O(sqrt(N)), where `N` is the number being checked.
   - Since we check each number in the range [a, b], the total time complexity is O((b - a) * sqrt(b)).

4. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is O(1), as the program uses only a constant amount of extra space for storing temporary variables.

5. **Code Walkthrough**:
   - The code prints all prime numbers between `a` and `b` for each test case. For example, for the range [1, 10], it prints `2 3 5 7`, and for [10, 20], 
     it prints `11 13 17 19`.

/* 
Input-output explanation:
The input consists of two numbers `a` and `b`, which represent the starting and ending values of an interval.

- Input: a = 1, b = 10

/* 
Constraints explanation:
1. a and b are integers, where a <= b.
2. We need to check for primes in the interval from `a` to `b`.
3. The number `1` is not considered a prime number.

5. The function should consider edge cases like when `a` and `b` are small or large.

/* 
Relatable analogy or real-world scenario:
Imagine you are at a party with people standing in a line, 
and you need to find out which of them are "prime party guests.
" A "prime party guest" is someone who can only be divided evenly by themselves or the number 1. 

Your task is to go down the line and check each guest (number) one by one.
You don't need to check guests that have already been proven to be "prime" 
(those who can't be divided by any number other than themselves and 1).
You start by checking the first person in the line (the smallest number in the range)
and continue until you reach the last person (the largest number in the range). 
Only the "prime" guests (prime numbers) should be invited to the special prime party. 

Step-by-step:
1. Start at the first guest (the number `a`), and check if they are a "prime guest."
2. Move to the next person (next number) and check if they're also a "prime guest."
3. Repeat the process until you reach the last person (the number `b`).
4. For each person, you check if they are divisible by any number other than themselves and 1.
   If they are, they are not a "prime guest" and you move on to the next one.

By following this method, you can find all the prime guests at the party!

/* 
Relatable analogy Java code step by step:

1. We need to create a function that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as parameters.
2. Inside this function, we'll loop through all numbers in the interval `[a, b]`.
3. For each number, check if it is prime.
4. A number is prime if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. To check this, 
   we'll check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
5. If the number is prime, we will add it to our result.
6. Once the loop finishes, we print all the prime numbers.

        (`isPrime` and `findPrimesInRange`) with each iteration for the given input, `a = 1` and `b = 10`.
        ---
         Function 1: `isPrime(n)`
        
        The function `isPrime(n)` checks whether a number `n` is prime by checking 
        if it can be divided by any number between `2` and `sqrt(n)`. 
        Here is the breakdown of how the `for` loop inside the `isPrime(n)` function works during each iteration:
        
         Input: `n = 1 to 10` (we will call `isPrime(n)` for each number in the range)
        
        1. Iteration 1: `n = 1`
           - The `isPrime(1)` function is called.
           - Check: The first condition `if (n <= 1)` is true, so the function immediately returns `false`.
           - No further iterations inside the loop, as the function returns early.
           
        2. Iteration 2: `n = 2`
           - The `isPrime(2)` function is called.
           - Check: The first condition `if (n <= 1)` is false.
           - The `for` loop will check divisibility for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `sqrt(2) â‰ˆ 1.41`.
             - For `i = 2`: The condition `i * i <= n` (`2 * 2 <= 2`) is false, so the loop doesn't run.
             - Since no divisors are found, the function returns `true`, indicating 2 is prime.
        
        3. Iteration 3: `n = 3`
           - The `isPrime(3)` function is called.
           - Check: The first condition `if (n <= 1)` is false.
           - The `for` loop will check divisibility for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `sqrt(3) â‰ˆ 1.73`.
             - For `i = 2`: The condition `i * i <= n` (`2 * 2 <= 3`) is true, so the loop executes.
             - The loop checks if `3 % 2 == 0`. Since `3 % 2 = 1`, it's not divisible by 2.
             - Since no divisors are found, the function returns `true`, indicating 3 is prime.
        
        4. Iteration 4: `n = 4`
           - The `isPrime(4)` function is called.
           - Check: The first condition `if (n <= 1)` is false.

             - For `i = 2`: The condition `i * i <= n` (`2 * 2 <= 4`) is true, so the loop executes.
             - The loop checks if `4 % 2 == 0`. Since `4 % 2 = 0`, it is divisible by 2.
             - The function immediately returns `false`, indicating 4 is not prime.
        
        5. Iteration 5: `n = 5`
           - The `isPrime(5)` function is called.
           - Check: The first condition `if (n <= 1)` is false.
           - The `for` loop will check divisibility for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `sqrt(5) â‰ˆ 2.23`.
             - For `i = 2`: The condition `i * i <= n` (`2 * 2 <= 5`) is true, so the loop executes.
             - The loop checks if `5 % 2 == 0`. Since `5 % 2 = 1`, it's not divisible by 2.
             - For `i = 3`: The condition `i * i <= n` (`3 * 3 <= 5`) is false, so the loop terminates.
             - Since no divisors are found, the function returns `true`, indicating 5 is prime.
        
        6. Iteration 6: `n = 6`

             - For `i = 2`: The condition `i * i <= n` (`2 * 2 <= 6`) is true, so the loop executes.
             - The loop checks if `6 % 2 == 0`. Since `6 % 2 = 0`, it's divisible by 2.
             - The function immediately returns `false`, indicating 6 is not prime.
        
        7. Iteration 7: `n = 7`
           - The `isPrime(7)` function is called.
           - Check: The first condition `if (n <= 1)` is false.
           - The `for` loop will check divisibility for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `sqrt(7) â‰ˆ 2.65`.
             - For `i = 2`: The condition `i * i <= n` (`2 * 2 <= 7`) is true, so the loop executes.
             - The loop checks if `7 % 2 == 0`. Since `7 % 2 = 1`, it's not divisible by 2.
             - For `i = 3`: The condition `i * i <= n` (`3 * 3 <= 7`) is false, so the loop terminates.
             - Since no divisors are found, the function returns `true`, indicating 7 is prime.
        
        8. Iteration 8: `n = 8`
           - The `isPrime(8)` function is called.
           - Check: The first condition `if (n <= 1)` is false.

             - For `i = 2`: The condition `i * i <= n` (`2 * 2 <= 8`) is true, so the loop executes.
             - The loop checks if `8 % 2 == 0`. Since `8 % 2 = 0`, it's divisible by 2.
             - The function immediately returns `false`, indicating 8 is not prime.
        
        9. Iteration 9: `n = 9`
           - The `isPrime(9)` function is called.

           - The `for` loop will check divisibility for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `sqrt(9) = 3`.
             - For `i = 2`: The condition `i * i <= n` (`2 * 2 <= 9`) is true, so the loop executes.
             - The loop checks if `9 % 2 == 0`. Since `9 % 2 = 1`, it's not divisible by 2.
             - For `i = 3`: The condition `i * i <= n` (`3 * 3 <= 9`) is true, so the loop executes.
             - The loop checks if `9 % 3 == 0`. Since `9 % 3 = 0`, it's divisible by 3.
             - The function immediately returns `false`, indicating 9 is not prime.

              - The loop checks if `10 % 2 == 0`. Since `10 % 2 = 0`, it's divisible by 2.
              - The function immediately returns `false`, indicating 10 is not prime.
        
        ---
        
         Function 2: `findPrimesInRange(a, b)`
        
        The `findPrimesInRange(a, b)` function iterates over the range `[a, b]` and calls the `isPrime(n)` function
        to check if each number is prime. If the number is prime, it prints it.
        
        Input: `a = 1` and `b = 10`
        
        1. Iteration 1: `i = 1`
           - `isPrime(1)` is called (as explained earlier, 1 is not prime).
           - Output: Nothing is printed.
        
        2. Iteration 2: `i = 2`
           - `isPrime(2)` is called (as explained earlier, 2 is prime).

         Summary:
        The `for` loop in both functions iterates through the numbers in the range `[a, b]` 
        and checks for primality using the logic described above. 
        The prime numbers printed by `findPrimesInRange(a, b)` for the input `a = 1` and `b = 10` are: `2, 3, 5, 7`.

/* 
Time and Space Complexity Explanation:

Time Complexity:
- For each number in the range `[a, b]`, we check if it's prime.
- Checking if a number is prime takes up to âˆšn iterations (where n is the number being checked).
- So, in the worst case, if we check every number from `a` to `b`, the time complexity will be O((b - a + 1) * âˆšb).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1), since we only use a constant amount of extra space (for variables like `i` and the result of the prime check). We don't store any large data structures.

FOR loop walkthrough with every iteration with the given input, Complete code walkthrough with applying the given input in code:

1. For input a = 1 and b = 10:
   - We start with `i = 1` and check if it's prime. Since 1 is not prime, we move to the next number.
   - For `i = 2`, we check if it's prime. It is, so we print 2.
   - Continue for numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, checking primality and printing primes (3, 5, 7).
   
2. For input a = 10 and b = 20:
   - We start with `i = 10` and check if it's prime. It isn't, so we move to the next number.
   - For `i = 11`, we check if it's prime. It is, so we print 11.
   - Continue for numbers 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20, checking primality and printing primes (13, 17, 19).

This walkthrough ensures we identify prime numbers efficiently within the given range.
