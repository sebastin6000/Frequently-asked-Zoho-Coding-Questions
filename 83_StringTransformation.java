Question:
We are given two strings `s` and `t` of equal length `n`. You can perform the following operation on string `s`:

Remove a suffix of `s` of length `l` (where 0 < l < n) and append it at the start of `s`. 
For example, let `s = 'abcd'`, then in one operation, you can remove the suffix `'cd'` and append it in front of `s` making `s = 'cdab'`.

You are also given an integer `k`. Your task is to return the number of ways in which string `s` can be transformed into string `t` in exactly `k` operations. 

Since the answer can be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdab", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- First way:
  - In the first operation, choose suffix starting from index 3 (suffix = "dabc").
  - In the second operation, choose suffix starting from index 3 (suffix = "cdab").
- Second way:
  - In the first operation, choose suffix starting from index 1 (suffix = "bcda").
  - In the second operation, choose suffix starting from index 1 (suffix = "cdab").

Example 2:
Input: s = "ababab", t = "ababab", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
- First way: Choose suffix starting from index 2, so the resulting s = "ababab".
- Second way: Choose suffix starting from index 4, so the resulting s = "ababab".

Constraints:
- \(2 \leq \text{s.length} \leq 5 \times 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\)
- s.length == t.length
- s and t consist of only lowercase English alphabets.

/* 
Understanding the Problem Statement:

1.1 Explanation of the Problem Statement:
- You are given two strings `s` and `t` of equal length `n`.
- A valid operation consists of removing a suffix of `s` and appending it at the start of `s`.
- We are asked to compute how many ways we can transform `s` into `t` using exactly `k` such operations.

1.2 What is being asked:
- We need to count how many ways `s` can be transformed into `t` in exactly `k` operations.

/* 
Extracting Information from the Problem Statement:

2.1 Input Data Type:
- Two strings `s` and `t` of equal length `n`.
- Integer `k` representing the exact number of operations.

2.2 Expected Output:
- The expected output is an integer representing the number of ways to transform `s` into `t` in exactly `k` operations.

2.3 Output Return Type:
- The output is an integer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2.4 Explanation of Time Complexity Expectations:
- Given that `n` can be up to \(5 \times 10^5\) and `k` can be as large as \(10^{15}\), 
  the solution should efficiently handle both large `n` and large `k`. This suggests that a brute-force solution may not be feasible.

2.5 Explanation of Given Constraints:
- The large value for `k` implies that we need to find an efficient solution that avoids simulating each operation individually.

/* 
Thinking Solution for the Problem Statement:

3.1 Identification Part:
- This problem is related to cyclic shifts and string matching.
- The key observation is that after one operation, the string `s` will undergo a cyclic shift. We need to find how many distinct shifts of `s` match `t`.

3.2 Destructuring:
- Since each operation removes a suffix and prepends it to `s`, this operation can be seen as a "cyclic shift".
- We need to compute how many times `s` can be transformed into `t` after exactly `k` operations.
- The problem can be reduced to understanding how many distinct rotations of `s` match `t`.

3.3 Conversional solution into smaller subtask:
- **Subtask 1**: Identify all distinct cyclic shifts of `s` that match `t`.
- **Subtask 2**: Compute how many times these shifts can be achieved in `k` operations.
- **Subtask 3**: Take into account the large value of `k` and find an efficient way to calculate the number of valid transformations.

Time and Space Complexity Explanation:

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of generating all cyclic shifts is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.
- The modular exponentiation operation is O(log k) for each valid shift.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log k), which is efficient enough for the input limits.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n) to store the valid shifts and the string manipulations.

/* 
If used any "for" loop or "while" loop, you have walkthrough all the "for" loop used in the code:

1. The first `for` loop iterates over each cyclic shift of string `s` and checks if the shift matches `t`.
2. The second `for` loop performs modular exponentiation to compute the number of ways each shift can occur in exactly `k` operations.

*/

 /* 
Complete code walkthrough with applying the given input in code and explanation:

1. In the first example (`s = "abcd"`, `t = "cdab"`, `k = 2`):
   - Generate all cyclic shifts of `s`. The valid shifts are indices 3 and 1.
   - For each valid shift, calculate the number of ways it can be achieved in 2 operations using modular exponentiation.
   - The answer is 2.

2. In the second example (`s = "ababab"`, `t = "ababab"`, `k = 1`):
   - The string is already equal to `t`, so the valid shifts are indices 2 and 4.
   - For each valid shift, calculate the number of ways it can be achieved in 1 operation using modular exponentiation.
   - The answer is 2.
